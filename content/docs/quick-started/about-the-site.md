## About Me

Welcome to [Enterprise Architecture Work], your top source for expert insight and guidance on Enterprise Architecture.

I'm Xiaowen, the founder of this site. 

With over two decades of experience working with Fortune 500 companies, I've come to realize the paramount importance of enterprise architecture and, paradoxically, how often it is overlooked. As a result, I founded this website to systematically share and organize knowledge related to enterprise architecture, including tutorials, news, and insights.
