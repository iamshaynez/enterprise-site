## Understanding the BIAN How-to Guide

The How-to Guide is segmented into several key areas:

### Introduction to BIAN

BIAN aims to standardize banking functions and service interactions to solve the problem of complex application portfolios in banks. The BIAN Service Landscape is iterative and seeks industry contributions for continuous refinement.

### Core Documents

The BIAN standard includes several crucial documents such as the BIAN Service Landscape, How-to Guide series, Metamodel, Business Scenario Definitions, Service Domain Definitions, and an API Directory from release V7.0.

### Feedback Process

Feedback is encouraged via the BIAN Wiki, Architectural Committee, or directly through the BIAN website and dedicated email for non-members.

## Content Overview

The How-to Guide is structured into the following sections:

1. **Design Principles & Techniques**: Intended for architects to understand the BIAN approach.
2. **Developing Content**: Directed at BIAN working group members, detailing the current working approach and tools.
3. **Applying the BIAN Standard**: Meant for financial institutions looking to apply BIAN design content technically.

### A Different Approach to a Well Established Problem

BIAN adopts a functional capacity-oriented approach that differs from conventional process-centric designs. The analogy of city planning is used to explain how BIAN's approach leads to a well-architected application map.

## BIAN How-to Guide - Detailed Sections

### Design Principles & Techniques

Explains the key design concepts and techniques employed in BIAN, such as Business Functional Capacity Partitions, Modeling Real World Behaviors, and interpreting the BIAN Standard in different situations.

### Developing Content

Describes the internal organization and approach for developing BIAN standard content, including the roles of Architecture Framework & Foundation and Service Landscape teams.

### Applying the BIAN Standard

Provides guidelines on using BIAN specifications for high-level implementation design, assembling a representative enterprise blueprint, and analysis.

## Figures and Tables

The document includes several figures and tables that compare business and city planning, illustrate the migration to a well-architected application map, and outline the design principles and techniques.

## Concluding Remarks

The BIAN How-to Guide V7.0 is a crucial document that outlines the methodology for standardizing banking architecture, promoting a collective movement towards a streamlined, efficient, and cooperative banking industry.
