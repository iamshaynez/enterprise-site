### Using TOGAF to Define and Govern Service-Oriented Architecture (Kindle Edition)

![Using TOGAF to Define and Govern Service-Oriented Architecture (Kindle Edition)](https://cdn.sa.net/2024/02/06/7RwTWONld9oCM3Z.png)

The purpose of this Technical Guide is to provide guidance on how the architect can use TOGAF - now in Version 9 - to develop, manage, and govern Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) or any architecture where SOA is part of the scope. This should facilitate the common understanding of the process for the development of SOAs and greatly improve alignment between the business and information technology communities. Utilization of the process, meta-model, references, and other TOGAF facilities will lead to the further adoption of SOA as an architectural style.

### TOGAF is NOT an EA Framework: The Inconvenient Pragmatic Truth

![TOGAF is NOT an EA Framework: The Inconvenient Pragmatic Truth](https://cdn.sa.net/2024/02/06/PvIZkGFwjozC9rD.png)

From the author:

> Why did I decide to compile this book?
> 
> I believe that TOGAF has done more to damage the EA “profession” (such as it isn’t!) than anything else in the world, and that the EA “profession” would be in a much better place today if TOGAF had never existed.
> 
> There are two main confusions that exist with regards to peoples (practitioners and management) understanding of EA.
>
> 1) Most people (90% perhaps) think that “it’s all about IT”.
> 2) Most people (90% perhaps) think that its all about running (mostly large) IT projects.
> 
> And the reason for this mass misunderstanding is because this is what TOGAF tends to push. People are told that TOGAF is an EA framework by the confused majority and so new people believe it to, which of course, adds to the majority thinking and saying the same wrong things.
> 
> These fundamental misunderstandings have to be tackled if an EA profession is to exist.
>
> I compiled this book to start a proper debate on the subject and also to allow people to realise that there is a choice out there between which EA frameworks they can use and who they talk to that may have different ideas to The Open Group.

As the editor of EA.Work, I highly recommend reading this piece as well. In practice, TOGAF should not be treated as the definitive bible for enterprise architecture. In the real world, it's essential to adapt its concepts to fit the unique needs of various companies.

Remember, it's not always about playing by the book. LOL
