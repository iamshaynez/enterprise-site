Organizations today face a constant debate between **customization** and **standardization** when designing their **business process models**. Customization provides flexibility to meet unique needs, while standardization enables efficiency through proven best practices. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of each approach, provides guidance on finding the optimal balance, and answers common questions managers have regarding this decision. 

## Understanding Customization

**Customization** involves tailoring business processes to match an organization's specific requirements and objectives. Some key advantages of customization include:

- **Flexibility** to adapt to changing conditions and new opportunities
- **Competitive differentiation** through unique value propositions 
- **Improved efficiency** by eliminating redundant steps

However, customization also has some limitations:

- **Higher costs** for development and maintenance
- **Complexity** in managing customized processes  
- **Lack of standardization** leading to inconsistencies

Overall, **46% of organizations** surveyed rely heavily on customization for their critical processes.

## Examining Standardization 

**Standardization** focuses on adopting standardized, proven business process models across the organization. Benefits of standardization include:

- **Increased efficiency** through streamlined operations
- **Quality control** through established best practices
- **Enhanced collaboration** across teams

But standardization also poses some downsides:

- **Lack of flexibility** to meet unique needs
- **Resistance to change** from employees
- **Loss of competitive differentiation** 

**Industry research** shows **74% of organizations** leverage standardized processes for non-critical back-office functions.
