## Introduction

In the dynamic and competitive business environment of today, organizations are constantly striving to optimize their operations, enhance decision-making processes, and ensure the alignment of IT systems with their strategic objectives. Enterprise Architecture (EA) serves as a holistic approach to managing and aligning an organization's business and IT strategies, enabling effective decision-making and facilitating business transformation.

With a multitude of EA frameworks available, it can be a daunting task for organizations to select the most appropriate one for their needs. This article aims to compare and analyze five popular Enterprise Architecture frameworks: Zachman, TOGAF, FEAF, Gartner, and DoDAF. By exploring their key features, strengths, weaknesses, and use cases, we hope to assist you in making an informed decision when selecting an EA framework for your organization.

## 1. Zachman Framework

- It lacks detailed guidance on implementation and execution, requiring organizations to develop their own methodologies.
- The framework may not be suitable for organizations with rapidly changing business environments, as it focuses more on structure than agility.

### Use Cases

- The Zachman Framework is often used in large organizations with complex IT landscapes, where a structured approach to EA is essential.
- It is particularly useful in industries with strict regulatory requirements, such as finance and healthcare, where compliance is critical.
