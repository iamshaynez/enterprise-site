# Top Enterprise Architecture Tools Guide

Explore the most popular tools that help organizations manage enterprise architecture and drive digital transformation efforts effectively.

Once upon a time, enterprise architecture (EA) could be sketched on a napkin. This simplicity was echoed by IBM's Thomas Watson Jr., who once remarked that he foresaw a global demand for only five computers. Fast forward to today, where even small companies might operate thousands of devices, not to mention the IoT gadgets. EA systems now serve as the crucial foundation for understanding and managing these vast networks of machines and the interplay of software running on them.

The market for EA tools is vibrant, with a multitude of strong contenders. Some are tailored to particular clouds, while others integrate tightly with business intelligence (BI) and business process management (BPM) systems. Whether originating as general modeling tools or designed specifically for EA, all of them help organizations catalog their IT assets and provide visual dashboards for tracking.

EA systems can collect information in different ways: the most hands-on approach involves surveys filled out by team members, whereas the most automated systems directly assess company clouds. Most tools combine these methods, adding features like drag-and-drop interfaces for easy modeling of IT landscapes.

With these tools, everyone from CIOs to emergency response teams can use dashboards to understand data flows and processes. Some tools focus on identifying and repairing system failures, while others help plan for the future by pinpointing inefficiencies or shortcuts.

Many EA tools incorporate [ArchiMate](https://www.archimatetool.com/), a modeling language that works with [TOGAF](/docs/frameworks/100-togaf/togaf-the-open-group-architecture-framework/), allowing for detailed visualization of complex architectures akin to UML (Unified Modeling Language).

When selecting an EA tool, integration with your existing software stack is crucial. Each tool supports various modules for different clouds or operating systems, but some are more compatible than others. Additionally, consider how well they connect with cloud services and compute environments.

To choose the right tool, assess how well it integrates with your technology and the clarity of its charts and tables. Here's an alphabetical list of top enterprise architecture platforms currently available:
